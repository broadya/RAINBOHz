/*
--------------------------------------
Defines various contstants, limits, type equivalents that are useful during additive synthesis
calculations.

Defines all of the simple struct types used in additive synthesis calculations, and includes asserts
for their invariants. These are intentionally not held in classes with encapsulation because they
have a role simply to pass around structured data and not to perform operations on that data.

The types are decoupled from the classes that can render audio based on them. This is to allow for
distributed processing of the types, where the proess of specifying a synthesis "compute job" will
be independent from actually performing that "compute job".

The types are immutable.

The main types build up in a hierarchy as follows -

PaxelSpecification | A single paxel that can be of any duration.

MultiPaxelSpecification | A vector of PaxelSpecification that are all of the same duration, but each
repesents some subdivision of that duration without overlaps.

PartialSpecification | A vector of MultiPaxelSpecification that describes the evolution of a single
partial.

MultiPartialSpecification | A vector of PartialSpecification that describes some bundle of partials
that are to be rendered together.

The other types describe the envelopes that specify a partial.

Envelope | A generic specification of an envelope following the same approach as sclang.

FrequencyEnvelope | An envelope representing evolution of the frequency of a partial.

AmplitudeEnvelope | An envelope representing evolution of the amplitude of a partial.

PhaseCoordinate | A point in the evolution of a partial where a certain phase must be achieved, or
where specifically the "natural" phase must be used. Natural phase is an important concept in the
RAINBOHz additive synthesis approach; it means "the phase that the partial it would naturally have
at this point, if unmodified".

PhaseCoordinates | A vector of PhaseCoordinate representing all points in evolution of the partial
where the phase is defined (or at least is explicitly at the "natural" phase). These coordinates
also define the begin and the end of a partial.

PartialEnvelopes | An aggregation of FrequencyEnvelope, AmplitudeEnvelope and PhaseCoordinates. It
fully specifies a partial, but does not place it at a particular starting point in a composition.
